# The kernel

The Kernel is the main part of any operating system and therefore should have the most work put into it

The Kernel design that we are aiming to develop is the microkernel kernel design.This I feel is the best way of designing a kernel. 

The kernel is also written in C as this is probably the best language to write a kernel with (assembly would take far to long)

## What should I do
Do what you think needs to be done, then send me a pull request and see if it gets pulled.
