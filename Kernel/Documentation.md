# The kernel

The Kernel is the main part of any operating system and therefore should have the most work put into it

The Kernel's design is a monolithic kernel design. The monolithic kernel design includes almost all of it's services
inside the kernel itself. This I feel is the best way of designing a kernel.

The kernel is also written in C as this is probably the best language to write a kernel with (assembly would take far to long)
