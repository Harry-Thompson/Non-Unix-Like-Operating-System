## Anyone is free to contribute but the code submitted must be up to scratch (whether it be assembly or c)

If you have an idea you would like to share I would be happy to hear it.
If you have some code you would like to contribute then I would be happy to look at if and (if it is good enougth I will pull it in) possibly pull it.

As for coding style there is a file on that in the main Documentation file labeled coding_style
