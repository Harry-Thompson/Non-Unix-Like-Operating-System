# YAK - Yet Another Kernel
A non Unix-like, non POSIX operating system

By Harry Thompson

## What is YAK exactly?
YAK is an attempt to rethink the way an operating sytem can work, it is non Unix and non POSIX compatible. The goal is to create an operating system which is completely different from the mainstream operating systems around today. YAK is also released under the GPL v2 license

## What's the point?
Unix and Unix-like operating systems are old, and we keep having to change the way they work to satisfy the modern worlds needs.
So that's why I am developing YAK, to bring a new way of designing an operating systems to light.

## Want to contribute?
See anything you think you could help with within YAK? Then feel free to send me a pull request. Also don't forget to read the CONTRIBUTING.md file. If you want to know what is currently being worked on then look at the TODO.md file.

## How can I install it?
Currently the project is a long way from hitting a stable release that you can intstall. But if you really want to speed up the process, it would be much appreciated if you were to contribute to the project
