# Obsidian
### A Unix-like Object Orientated Operating System

Written in C & Assembly

By Harry Thompson

## What is Obsidian?
Obsidian is an attempt to rethink the way an operating system can work, it is Unix-like and POSIX compliant as these are the best two things an operating system can be. But we are taking a different approach to that of some of the most popular Unix-like operating systems today. In Obsidian everything is an object instead of the normal Unix design in which everything is a file. This gives us an interesting opportunity to rethink how a Unix-like operating system can work. The main is to create an object orientated operating system which is completely different from the mainstream operating systems around today. It is also released under the GPL v2 license, so any one is free to look at the code, make changes to the code and then redistribute those changes.

## Why are we creating this operating system?
The current Unix and Unix-like operating systems are old, and we keep having to change the way they work to satisfy the modern worlds needs.
So that's why I am developing a new Unix-like operating system, to bring a new way of designing an operating systems to light. The object orientated design of Obsidian means that the resulting operating system would be highly extensible and stable.

## What are we creating?
Not only our we creating a kernel, we are also creating an object-orientated shell to go with it, aswell as a suite of applications to create what we feel will be a fully object-orientated operating system.

## Want to contribute?
There is a lot of work to do and it would be much appreciated if you would be willing to contribute. Read the CONTRIBUTING.md file to find out how to get started. Also read the TODO.md file to find out what currently has to be done . Or look at the current issues to find things that you think you could do and/or fix.

## Why should I contribute?
Because you will be helping develop a giant leap forward in terms of operating design and implementation. The dream of fully object-orientated operating systems has never truly been realized, that's is where Obsidian comes in, I believe that with your help we will be able to realize this dream.
