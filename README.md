# NON UNIX LIKE OS (NAME COMING SOON)
A non Unix-like, non POSIX comattible opensource operating system

Written in C & Assembly

By Harry Thompson

## What is this operating system exactly?
This operating system is an attempt to rethink the way an operating sytem can work, it is non Unix and non POSIX compatible. The goal is to create an operating system which is completely different from the mainstream operating systems around today. It is also released under the GPL v2 license.

## Why are we creating this operating system?
Unix and Unix-like operating systems are old, and we keep having to change the way they work to satisfy the modern worlds needs.
So that's why I am developing a new operating system, to bring a new way of designing an operating systems to light.

## Want to contribute?

If you want to know what is currently being worked on then look at the TODO.md file. Or look at the current issues to find things that you think you could do.

## Why should I contribute?
Because you will be helping develop a giant leap forward interms of operating design and implemtation

## How can I install it?
Currently the project is a long way from hitting a stable release that you can intstall. But if you really want to speed up the process, it would be much appreciated if you were to contribute to the project.
