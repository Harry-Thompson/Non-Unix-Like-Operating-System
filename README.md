# Obsidian
An objective operating system

Written in C & Assembly

By Harry Thompson

## What is Obsidian xactly?
This operating system is an attempt to rethink the way an operating sytem can work, it is non Unix and non POSIX compatible. The goal is to create an object orientated operating system which is completely different from the mainstream operating systems around today. It is also released under the GPL v2 license.

## Why are we creating this operating system?
Unix and Unix-like operating systems are old, and we keep having to change the way they work to satisfy the modern worlds needs.
So that's why I am developing a new operating system, to bring a new way of designing an operating systems to light.

## Want to contribute?
There is alot of work to do and it would be much appreciated if you would be willing to contribute. Read the CONTRIBUTING.md file to find out how to get started. Also read the TODO.md file to find out what currently has to be done . Or look at the current issues to find things that you think you could do and/or fix.

## Why should I contribute?
Because you will be helping develop a giant leap forward interms of operating design and implemtation

## How can I install it?
Currently the project is a long way from hitting a stable release that you can intstall. But if you really want to speed up the process, it would be much appreciated if you were to contribute to the project.
