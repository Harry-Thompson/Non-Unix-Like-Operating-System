# Contributing
Everyone can contribute, in fact I encourage people to do so 

## How to contribute
First of all your going to want to clone (or fork) the YAK repository and then make sure it is up to date. Then you can start looking at the source code. If you see anything you think you help with then you are welcome to do so. Then commit changes and send me the change you would like to make in the form of a pull request (make sure it adheres to YAK's chosen coding style which is in the a file within the main documentation file labeled coding style). Also make sure that the commit description reasonably describes what your code does.

## What needs to be done
If you want to know what is currently being worked on or you just want something to do, take a look at the TODO.md file.
