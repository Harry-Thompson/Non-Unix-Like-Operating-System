# Contributing
Everyone can contribute, in fact I encourage people to do so 

## How to contribute
First of all your going to want to clone the YAK repository and then make sure it is up to date. Then you can start looking at the source code. If you see anything you think you help with then you are welcome to do so. Then commit and send me the a pull request with the code you have written (make sure it adheres to YAK's chosen coding style which is in the a file within the main documentation file labeled coding style)
