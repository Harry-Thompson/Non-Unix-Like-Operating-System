# Obsidian's Design Philosophy
Obsidian builds upon the original Unix design philosophy, but differs in a few key areas


* Everything is an object
* When a program becomes old and outdated, it is scraped and rewritten from scratch
* When writing programs you first implement security before you implement performance
